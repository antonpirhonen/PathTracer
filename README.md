## Introduction
---------------

 In this project, our team of five planned and implemented a path tracer. 
 Our main goal was that our path tracer could render images of different environments that include objects of any shape. 
 We also wanted our path tracer to be user friendly so one of our goals was to make the user interface simple to use.


## Main features
----------------

- Monte Carlo integration
- Parsing objects from .obj files
- Multiple material options for objects
- Smooth mesh surfaces with phong normal interpolation
- Custom scenes with .json files
- Rendered image saved as .png
- Multi-thread rendering
- Simple to use!
 
 
## Directory structure
----------------------

  * `build/` -- Folder for storing objects during compilation

  * `doc/` -- Final documentation of our path tracer, also includes user guide!

  * `plan/` -- Project plan

  * `src/` -- Source code for building the path tracer
