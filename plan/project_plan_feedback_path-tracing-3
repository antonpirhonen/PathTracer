Path tracing 3

Excellent plan! All the required points are present and done well. I especially like how you plan to review code - I believe that will have a definitive impact on
how much you learn during this course. Having a lot of question marks questions left open is kind of unstylish, but works with the functional nature of the document. Also the description on
how the program will work could be a bit more detailed.
The part pertaining how you work together as a group is a definite strength of this plan, and I like it very much.
